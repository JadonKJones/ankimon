"""Friendship- and time-of-day-based evolution helpers.

<<<<<<< HEAD
This module is the single source of truth for:
- the in-game day/night clock (derived from the local system clock + settings),
- which friendship evolution(s) a species can undergo,
- whether a given Pokémon is *ready* to evolve via friendship right now, and
- triggering that evolution through the existing :class:`EvoWindow`.

Friendship evolutions in the bundled data (``pokemon_evolution.csv``) are encoded
as ``evolution_trigger_id == 1`` (level-up) rows that carry a positive
``minimum_happiness`` and, for some species, a ``time_of_day`` of ``"day"`` or
``"night"`` (e.g. Eevee -> Espeon by day / Umbreon at night). The legacy
level-up evolution code skips these because they have a blank ``minimum_level``.

Circular-import note
--------------------
This module is imported (directly or transitively) by ``pc_box.py``,
``encounter_functions.py``, ``trainer_functions.py`` and ``pokemon_details.py``.
``singletons.py`` imports ``pc_box`` at module top level *before* it binds the
``settings_obj`` singleton, so importing ``settings_obj`` at this module's top
level would crash at addon load. Therefore ``settings_obj`` is imported lazily,
inside each function that needs it, by which point ``singletons`` is fully
initialised. The ``pokedex_functions`` / ``resources`` imports below have no such
back-edge and are safe at top level.
=======
Single source of truth for the in-game day/night clock, a species' friendship
evolution(s), whether a Pokémon is ready to evolve right now, and triggering that
evolution via :class:`EvoWindow`. Friendship evolutions live in
``pokemon_evolution.csv`` as level-up rows (``evolution_trigger_id == 1``) with a
positive ``minimum_happiness`` and an optional ``time_of_day``; the legacy
level-up code skips them because their ``minimum_level`` is blank.

``settings_obj`` is imported lazily inside each function, not at module top level:
``singletons`` imports ``pc_box`` (which imports this module) before binding
``settings_obj``, so a top-level import would crash at addon load.
